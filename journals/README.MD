## Journals

Please keep all of your individual journals in this directory.

Each team member is required to keep a development journal, which should be a single markdown file with an entry for each day the project was worked on.

Recommended naming convention is `first_last.md`.

1. `Functionality`: Articulate the capabilities of your app or service. :hammer_and_wrench:
- E.g.: Our RESTful API enables CRUD operations for movie reviews.

Our app named 'Catalist' is a journaling app where the user can write about their day in an online journal and also record tasks in a to-do list. The journals and tasks are saved to the user's account so they can view it later. Catalist uses CRUD operations with FastAPI in the backend and React + CSS to generate the frontend.

2. `User Stories/Scenarios`: Outline key use-cases, ideally using Gherkin syntax. :cucumber:
- E.g.: `Given` a user is logged in, `When` they post a review, `Then` it appears on their profile.
3. `Intended Market`: Clearly define your user persona and target demographic. :dart:
- E.g.: Aimed at cinephiles who appreciate algorithmic review recommendations.
4. `Stretch Goals`: Document “nice-to-haves” in your product roadmap. :rainbow:
- E.g.: Implement a recommendation engine via collaborative filtering.
5. `Onboarding`: Detail the local dev setup, branching strategy, .env, 3rd party api keys, and CI/CD pipeline. :rocket:
- E.g.: Fork the repo, clone locally, install dependencies via `npm install`, and checkout to a feature branch.
6. `Tech Stack`: Specify technologies, libraries, and frameworks. :books:
- E.g.: React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker.
7. `Journaling`: Maintain a dev log, perhaps in a `CHANGELOG.md`. :scroll:
8. `Documentation`: Attach DB schemas, wireframes, and API contracts. :clipboard:
-E.g.: point to the documents dir
9. `Issue Tracking`: Link to your Linear or JIRA board for bug tracking. :ladybug:
-E.g. - links or screenshoots, could be included in the doc’s dir
10. `Testing`: Describe unit tests. :white_check_mark:
-E.g. - <student name> : < location of test worked on>
