Spent a good amount of time trying to set up MongoDB server and containerize it. Made a model, router, and query file for accounts which will later be used to keep track of users and their profile settings.

Got FastAPIs running for account objects. Struggled with validation errors but managed to fix them. Started working on implementing authentication but am experiencing trouble with refactoring code to resemble more of what Curtis showed us. I think I'll be able to get it working tomorrow though.
