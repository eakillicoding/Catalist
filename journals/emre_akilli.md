We had a productive day and we got a sense of direction towards what we need to accomplish this week. Today was mostly setting up up the project template to be able to run using docker. Hopefully we make more progress tomorrow!

Today was interesting, we learned a lot about computer science concepts and in our group, we divided up all the work we need to get done. Looking forward to implementing the things we learned this week.

I had a productive day with my group, I have been planning on how to tackle the landing page and today we have collectively agreed on the theme. We all want to implement a pokemon theme so we will get into the details when we are back from break.

Its good to be back, I had a great break and traveled a lot and went to a lot of places in Orlando. Today we got back into it and we started to tackle our daily goals. We are having trouble with the backend so we will start mob coding to get it done.

Were at the halfway mark of this week and we have been mob coding a lot. We were able to aid Landon in his backend issue and now we are tackling the backend. We have started with adding dependencies in the package.json and tweaking the js files. Hopefully by the end of the week we finish front end auth.
