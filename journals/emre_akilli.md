Emre Akilli's Journal

September 25th:
We had a productive day and we got a sense of direction towards what we need to accomplish this week. Today was mostly setting up up the project template to be able to run using docker. Hopefully we make more progress tomorrow!

September 27th:
Today was interesting, we learned a lot about computer science concepts and in our group, we divided up all the work we need to get done. Looking forward to implementing the things we learned this week.

September 28th:
I had a productive day with my group, I have been planning on how to tackle the landing page and today we have collectively agreed on the theme. We all want to implement a pokemon theme so we will get into the details when we are back from break.

October 9th:
Its good to be back, I had a great break and traveled a lot and went to a lot of places in Orlando. Today we got back into it and we started to tackle our daily goals. We are having trouble with the backend so we will start mob coding to get it done.

October 11th:
Were at the halfway mark of this week and we have been mob coding a lot. We were able to aid Landon in his backend issue and now we are tackling the backend. We have started with adding dependencies in the package.json and tweaking the js files. Hopefully by the end of the week we finish front end auth.

October 13th: Its the end of the week and we have finished backend and frontend auth. Now our priority is to get on finishing the rest off the frontend. We are on a good track to finish the project and everyone is fulfilling their role. I have designed a elaborate nav bar, landing page and footer which I will start coding next weeek.

October 16th: I Have installed tailwind css and started refactoring the ghi to start coding the front end. I created a folder for the components, content, and the fonts so everything is organized. I have listened to feedback from my teammates and I will take in their considerations when coding the frontend this week.
