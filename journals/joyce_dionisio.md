Worked with group in order to dockerize/containerize project. We began with creating a volume named "mongodb-data" then by dockerizing, we were able to see the project on different ports. The four containers running are FastAPI-1,Ghi-1, Mongo-1, and Mongo-express-1. The terminal commands I utilized were: `docker volume create mongodb-data`; `docker compose build`; `docker compose up` --> can shorten this to `docker compose up --build`

Today, I struggled with getting familiarized with the new things we've been implementing. We primarily discussed a plan of action. My primary focus was getting familiarized with FastAPI. To do so, I rewatched the lecture on Fast API and followed along. I also went ahead and re-read the exploration on FastAPI.

Most of this was spent reconvening with the group and discsussing issues we ran into. At this point, I completed my FastAPI code for Todos and began trying to rewatch videos and do research on MongoDB. I still had difficulty understanding Mongo. I also allocated time in order to read about/ look at the exploration on SQL to ensure I was following and understanding. Later in the day I developed a bug that disabled the port to the database. I spent a few hours on this bug then gave up **_tears_**

Today, we decided to MOB code in an attempt to work through front end auth with Landon. There were issues that arose when he and Mark git pushed into the Main branch. We were able to solve this using `git revert`. After this I played around a bit more with my CRUD to see if things were written correctly

SpoOoOoKy! Friday the 13th! What's spookier is definitely the end of this module nearing us. We did a lot of talking as a group today and looked over some ideas for our front end. Emre showed us some photos/themes and we voted on a few. I'm still having backend issues- but as a group we've been asking for help from Whitley about the login/sign in/sign up.

Ok everything came crashing down. Today I was stuck because of a docker issue. Nothing would work. I attempted deleting and rebuilding containers and nothing fixed it. I eventually decided to delete all containers, volumes, and images and then pruned docker through my terminal. This resolved the issue.

Todo List is populating, however there's plenty of style issues. Dealt with some backend issues. I began coding frontend

Todo list and todo form progress has been working. I haven't been able to pull or push due to issues. I've accidentally gotten stuck in git hell. It seems as if rebasing is the issue

Pokemon cards in dev page are now complete. I had to write a lot from scratch due to issues in the grid.
